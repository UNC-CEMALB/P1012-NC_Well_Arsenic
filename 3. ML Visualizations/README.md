# Confusion Matrix Figure
- Visualization of confusion matrix metrics from supervised machine learning models (only RF and SVM from the first two use cases)
-  This was done to visualize the generalizability of the models' accuracy after removing longitude and latitude  in use case 2
  
# Decision Boundary Plot 
- Visualization of two  predictors in the top performing model to determine how well those variables could predict As well concentration

# Variable Importance Plot
- Shows importance of each predictor for top performing machine learning (ML) models
